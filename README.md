## Overview:
Here a model is designed for predictive analysis using python, machine learning algorithms. This model helps to predict whether a person can be diabetic or not considering various health conditions of that person as the attributes for the prediction.

## Purpose:
Based on the recent trends, studies say that there would be around 642
million diabetic patients all over the world which is an alarming figure . In order to be attentive this model predicts the risk level of patients based on parameters about their health. An android application is built where the patientsâ€™ health parameters are entered and the machine learning algorithm predicts the risk and type of diabetes and based on that a diet plan is provided to the patient.
## Existing Problem:
The number of diabetic patients is increasing exponentially day by day all
over the world. This is an alarming health issue that has to be addressed and resolved. One should be cautious and be alert about the risk level of being affected by diabetes and should prior care based on the health parameters. Lack of awareness of being affected is the main reason for the increasing number.
## Proposed Solution:
The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that effectively
predicts the risk level of a patient being diabetic based on the health parameters and alerts the patient by predicting the type of diabetes they can be affected by and suggests a proper diet chart which can prevent the patient from being diabetic. This machine learning is integrated with an android application where the patients can just enter all the health parameters asked and can get their predictions on their device.
